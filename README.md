## Recommendations
As it is working fine for Netflix all these years, I would like to recommend the follwoing things:

* If any Movie or TV Show has to be added to Netflix, the preferred months are July and January, because of Summer break in July and Winter break in January.

* Company should focus on adding more movies or TV Shows related to Dramas and International Movies.

* Apart from United States, Netflix should add more Content in India and United Kingdom as there is growing popularity in these countries.

* While adding any new movies, Netflix should focus on adding those movies which have duration of 1.5-2hr than anyother duration.

* Coming to TV Shows, netflix should focus on those TV Shows which have number of seasons less than 5.
